# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to identify the number of retiring employees per title.  These employees were identified as those who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.  In addition, this data also provided the number of employees that held a certain title to give insights into how many people of one type of title would potentially retire. 

The second section of the analysis also included identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  Eligibility assumption was based on current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.


## Results
1.  There are a total of 72,458 employees eligible for retirement based on the assumptions above.

2.  The retirement employees are broken down into the following categories with Senior Engineer and Senior Staff Engineer making up about 2/3 of the total number of employees.

## Summary

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
	- Utilizing the analysis above, 72,458 employees will retirement eligible.  Not all of these employees will retire at the exact same time, but the company needs to take action to ensure there is a plan in place to replace at least a portion of these employees and ensure there is proper knowledge transfer to less senior employees.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
	- Given that there are only 1,549 mentorship eligible employees, there are not enough employees to take over this wave of upcoming retirements.

- Upcoming "Silver Tsunami" Strategy
	- A solution to help overcome the upcoming wave of retirements and minimize the disruption across the company would be to expand the mentorship program to a larger population of employees.  Modifying the mentorship criteria from starting at January 1, 1965 to just 5 years older (January 1, 1960) expands the eligible mentorship employees from 1,549 to 93,756 respectively.  
	- There is also a large number of lower level engineers in this expanded pool that are probably ready to move up to more senior roles and need to have some mentorship to make this leap.  Comparing the retiring titles to this expanded list of mentorship eligible employee titles clearly shows that expanding the mentorship program could be a very affective strategy and will provide synergies across the organization.  It would also follow the natural progression of promoting lower level engineers up through the ranks to take over responsibilities when older employees decide to retire.  The table below displays these relationships.
